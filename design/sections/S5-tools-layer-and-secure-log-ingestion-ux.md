Tools layer and secure log ingestion UX

## Current implementation (source of truth)
- **Tool calls** are generated by the LLM and returned to the client (limited to one).
- **Tool results** can be sent back in `/explain` as `tool_results` and are appended to the LLM input.
- **No server-side tool execution** exists yet; operators run commands manually and paste results.
- **No secure upload pipeline** (pre-signed S3, ingestion service, etc.) is implemented.

## Not implemented yet (by code)
- S3 upload flow and redaction pipeline.
- Tool execution allow-lists and sandboxing.
- Tool output persistence and citation linking.
