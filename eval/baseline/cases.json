In AWS, creating a bucket requires the `s3:CreateBucket` permission on the **root resource** (`*`) and no explicit deny for that action. If the policy is limited to a specific bucket ARN or if another policy attached to the role contains an explicit deny, the call will still fail with `AccessDenied`.\n\n**Next step:** Verify that the role\u2019s policy allows `s3:CreateBucket` on `*` and that no other policy attached to the role or the account contains an explicit deny for this action. If you can share the full policy document (or a redacted snippet), I can confirm whether it meets these requirements.\n\nIf you\u2019re unable to share the policy, you can check it by running:\n```\naws iam get-role --role-name <role-name>\n```\nand reviewing the attached policies for the `s3:CreateBucket` statement.\n\nOnce the policy is corrected, re\u2011run the Terraform apply.\n",
